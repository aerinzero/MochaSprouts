We want to teach kids how to code and make it fun.

### Get Involved

Talk to either [Aaron](//twitter.com/aerinonfire) or [Mehul](//twitter.com/mehulkar).

### Get Your Kids Involved

If your child can do basic algebra, they're probably old enough to be a part of this. There's no such thing as too old, but we're probably going to keep it to under 18.
